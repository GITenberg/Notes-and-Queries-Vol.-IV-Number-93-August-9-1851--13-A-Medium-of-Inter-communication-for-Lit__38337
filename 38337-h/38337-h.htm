<h2><span class="bla">Notes.</span></h2>

<h3><span>LADY HOPTON.</span></h3>

<p>I have thought that the following old letter, relative to a family once
of some distinction, and especially as describing a very remarkable
individual, from whom a multitude of living persons are immediately
descended, might be of sufficient interest to occupy a place in
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." It has never, that I am aware of, been published; but it
has long been preserved, amongst similar papers, with the accompanying
endorsement:&mdash;"Though Mr. Ernle's letter relating to Lady Hopton and her
family contains some fabulous accounts, and is in some parts a little
unintelligible, yet it may be urged in confirmation of the truth of the
several descents therein mentioned. He was the son of Sir John Ernle,
and could not but have some general knowledge of his grandmother's
relations."</p>

<p>This Mr. Ernle, afterwards knighted, died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1686.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Hopton lived at Witham Friary, co. Somerset, and the heroine
of this document was, according to the pedigree in Sir R. C. Hoare's
<i>Monastic Remains of Witham</i>, &amp;c., Rachel, daughter of Edmund Hall of
Gretford, co. Lincoln, Esq. The date of Sir Arthur's death is not there
given, but he was made a K.B. in 1603.</p>

     <p class="right">C. W. B.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "I will give you as good an account as I can remember of our wise
   &amp; good Grandmother Hopton, who I think was one Hall's daughter of
   Devonshire without title, &amp; had an elder brother, without child,
   who said to his younger brother's wife, who was then with child,
   if she would come to his house, &amp; lie in, he would give his
   estate to it if a daughter, &amp; if a son it should fare never the
   worse: so she had my grandmother, &amp; he bred her up &amp; married her
   to Sir Arthur Hopton of Somerset: who had 4000 a year, &amp; she as
   much.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"By him she had 18 children; 10 daughters married; whose names
   were: Lady Bacon, Lady Smith, Lady Morton, Lady Bannister, &amp; Lady
   Fettiplace; Bingham, Baskett, Cole, Thomas, &amp; my Grandmother
   Ernle; these daughters &amp; their children have made a numerous
   company of relations. The duke of Richmond &amp; Lord Maynard married
   our Aunt Bannister's daughters &amp; heirs (one to Rogers, the other
   to Bannister).<a id="Bannister1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Fettiplace, which was also Lord Jones, his
   daughter &amp; heiress married Lord Lumley, now Scarbro.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Bannister1" class="label">[1]</a> ("The Lady Bannister's first husband was Mr. Rogers,
   of Brenson (<i>hodiè</i> Bryanston) near Blandford, in Dorsetshire: by
   him she had the Dutchess of Richmond, who was heiress to him: she
   had another daughter of Sir Robt. Bannister, who married Lord
   Mainard."&mdash;<i>Added in another Version.</i>)</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Cole's heir to Popham of Wilts: &amp; Hungerford, &amp; Warnford married
   Jones, &amp; some Mackworth, &amp; Wyndham in Wales; some Morgan, &amp;
   Cammish, &amp; Kern, with many others that I have forgot. The
   sons<a id="sons98"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[98]</span> were Mr Robt Hopton, Sir Thomas, Sir Arthur. Robt
   had one son, w<span class="topnum">ch</span> was the Lord Hopton of great worth, who
   married the Lord Lewen's widow, and had no child: so the estate
   went to the daughters. But our Grandfather Hopton, having so good
   an estate, thought he might live as high as he pleased, &amp; not run
   out: but one day he was going from home but c<span class="topnum">d</span> not, but told his
   Lady she w<span class="topnum">d</span> be left in great trouble, for the great debts he had
   made on his estate; &amp; that he knew he should live but few days, &amp;
   c<span class="topnum">d</span> not die in peace, to think what affliction he should leave
   her in: so she desired him to be no way concerned for his debts,
   for he owed not a penny to any one. So he died of a gangrene in
   his toe in a few days. Now she had set up an Iron-work, &amp; paid
   all he owed, unknown to him. And she married all her daughters to
   great estates, &amp; great families: her eldest, I think, to one
   Smith, who was a younger son, &amp; went factor to a merchant into
   Spain; he had a very severe master &amp; was very melancholy &amp; walked
   one morning in Spain intending to go &amp; sell himself a
   galley-slave to the Turks: but an old man met him, &amp; asked him
   why he was so melancholy; bid him cheer up himself, &amp; not go
   about what he intended, for his elder brother was dead, letters
   were coming to him to return home to his estate; bid him consider
   &amp; believe what he said, &amp; that when he went for England, the
   first house he entered, after this landing, he would marry the
   gentleman's eldest daughter: which he did. The Lady Hopton's way
   of living was very great: she had 100 in her family; all sorts of
   trades; and when good servants married she kept the families, &amp;
   bred them up to several trades. She rose at six of the Clock
   herself: went to the Iron-work, &amp; came in about 9; went with all
   her family to prayers, &amp; after dinner she &amp; her children &amp;
   grand-children went to their several works with her in the
   dining-room, where she spun the finest sheets that are. Every
   year she had all her children &amp; grandchildren met together at her
   house; &amp; before they went away, would know if any little or great
   animosities were between any of them; if so, she would never let
   them go, till they were reconciled."</p>


<h3><span>NOTES ON NEWSPAPERS&mdash;THE TIMES.</span></h3>

<p>There were sold of <i>The Times</i> of Tuesday, Feb. 10th, 1840, containing
an account of the Royal nuptials, 30,000 copies, and the following
curious calculations were afterwards made respecting this publication.
The length of a column of <i>The Times</i> is twenty-two inches. If every
copy of <i>The Times</i> then printed could be cut into forty-eight single
columns, and if those forty-eight columns were tacked to each other,
they would extend 494 miles and 1,593 yards. To give some idea of the
extent of that distance, it may be sufficient to say that one of the
wheels of the mail which runs from Falmouth to London, and again from
London to Easingwold, a small town twelve miles beyond York, might run
all the way on the letter-press so printed, except the last 167 yards.
The same extent of letter-press would reach from London to Paris, and
back again from Paris to Canterbury, and a little further. The 30,000
papers, if opened out and joined together, would cover a length of
twenty-two miles and 1,280 yards; or, in other words, would reach from
<i>The Times</i> office, in Printing-house Square, to the entrance hall in
Windsor Castle, leaving a few yards for stair carpets. It is recorded
that 20,000 copies were in the hands of the newsmen at eight o'clock in
the morning. Since 1840, the circulation of <i>The Times</i> has greatly
increased; and what was then deemed wonderful on an extraordinary
occasion, is now exceeded daily by 8,000 copies&mdash;the present daily
circulation being about 38,000 copies, which are worked by greatly
improved machinery at the rate of between 8,000 to 10,000 per hour. On
the 2nd of last May, <i>The Times</i> containing an account of the opening of
the Great Exhibition by the Queen, circulated to the enormous number of
52,000 copies, the largest number ever known of one daily newspaper
publication. Nothing can illustrate more forcibly than these statements
the great utility of the machinery employed in multiplying with so
miraculous a rapidity such an immense number of copies. When we look at
the great talent&mdash;the extensive arrangement&mdash;the vast amount of
information on a variety of topics&mdash;the immense circulation&mdash;the
rapidity with which it is thrown off, and the correctness of the details
of <i>The Times</i> paper&mdash;we are constrained to pronounce it the most
marvellous political journal the world has ever seen. What would our
forefathers have said to this wonderful broadsheet, which conveys
information of the world's movements to the teeming population of the
United Kingdom, and also to the people of other and distant climes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Days of the week:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday are lucky days.</p>

<p>Thursday has one lucky hour, viz. the hour before the sun rises.</p>

<p>Friday is unlucky.</p>

<p>It is very unlucky to turn a featherbed on a Sunday; my housemaid says
she would not turn my bed on a Sunday on any account.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"To sneeze on Monday hastens anger,</p>

<p> You'll see your true love before a week's past."</p>

<p>My informant cannot recollect the consequences of sneezing on Wednesday
and Thursday.</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Sneeze on Sunday morning fasting,</p>
     <p> You'll enjoy your own true love to everlasting."</p>
</div>

<p>If you sneeze on a Saturday night after the candle is lighted, you will
next week see a stranger you never saw before.</p>

<p>A new moon seen over the right shoulder is lucky, over the left shoulder
unlucky, and straight before prognosticates good luck to the end of the
moon.</p>

<p>Hair and nails should always be cut during the waning of the moon.</p>

<p>Whatever you think of when you see a star shooting, you are sure to
have.</p>

<p>When you first see the new moon in the new year, take your stocking off
from one foot, and run to the next style; when you get there, between
the great toe and the next, you will find a hair, which will be the
colour of your lover's.</p>

<p>When you first see the new moon after mid-summer, go to a stile, turn
your back to it, and say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"All hail, new moon, all hail to thee!</p>
      <p>I prithee good moon, reveal to me</p>
      <p> This night who shall my true love be:</p>
      <p>Who he is, and what he wears,</p>
      <p> And what he does all months and years."</p>

<p>Some time ago I was in the neighbourhood of Camelford (a small town in
Cornwall), and inquiring the name of a church I saw in the distance, was
told that its name was <i>Advent</i>, though it was generally called <i>Saint
Teen</i>. Now <i>Teen</i> in Cornish = to light. Can this name have been applied
from any peculiar ceremonies observed here during Advent?</p>

was held that though the frame-work of the windows belonged to the heir,
the <i>glass</i> was the property of the executors, and might therefore be
removed by them, "<i>quar le meason est perfite sauns le glasse</i>." In A.D.
1599 Lord Coke informs us it was in the Common Pleas "resolved <i>per

<h3><span>ON A SONG IN SCOTT'S PIRATE&mdash;"FIRE ON THE MAINTOP."</span></h3>

<p>In the 231st number of that excellent New York periodical, <i>The Literary
World</i>, published on the 5th of July, there is an article on "Steamboats
and Steamboating in the South West," in which I find the following
passage:&mdash;<a id="passage100"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"I mentioned the <i>refrain</i> of the firemen. Now as a particular one is
almost invariably sung by Negroes when they have anything to do with or
about a fire; whether it be while working at a New Orleans fire-engine,
or crowding wood into the furnaces of a steamboat; whether they desire
to make an extra racket at leaving, or evince their joy at returning to
a port, it may be worth recording; and here it is:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "'Fire on the quarter-deck,</p>
        <p class="i3">Fire on the bow,</p>
      <p>Fire on the gun-deck,</p>
     <p class="i3">Fire down below!'</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">"The last line is given by all hands with great vim (<i>sic</i>) and volume;
and as for the chorus itself, you will never meet or pass a boat, you
will never behold the departure or arrival of one, and you will never
witness a New Orleans fire, without hearing it."</p>

<p>The writer says nothing about the origin of this Negro melody, and
therefore he is, I presume, unaware of it. But many of your readers will
at once recognise the spirited lines, which when once they are read in
Walter Scott's <i>Pirate</i>, have somehow a strange pertinacity in ringing
in one's ears, and creep into a nook of the memory, from which they ever
and anon insist on emerging to the lips. The passage occurs at the end
of the fifth chapter of the third volume, where the pirates recapture
their runaway captain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "They gained their boat in safety, and jumped into it, carrying
   along with them Cleveland, to whom circumstances seemed to offer
   no other refuge, and pushed off for their vessel, singing in
   chorus to their oars an <i>old ditty</i>, of which the natives of
   Kirkwall could only hear the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "'Thus said the Rover</p>
        <p class="i3">To his gallant crew,</p>
      <p>Up with the black flag,</p>
       <p class="i3">Down with the blue!</p>
      <p>Fire on the main-top,</p>
      <p class="i3">Fire on the bow,</p>
      <p>Fire on the gun-deck,</p>
     <p class="i3">Fire down below!'"</p>
</div>

<p>So run the lines in the original edition, but in the revised one of the
collected novels in forty-eight volumes, and in all the subsequent ones,
the first two stand thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Robin Rover</p>
        <p class="i3">Said to his crew."</p>
</div>

<p>This alteration strikes one as anything but an improvement, and it has
suggested a doubt, which I beg to apply to the numerous and
well-informed body of your readers to solve. Are these lines the
production of Walter Scott, as they are generally supposed to be; or are
they really the fragment of an old ditty? The alteration at the
commencement does not seem one that would have found favour in the eyes
of an author, but rather the effect of a prompting of memory. I believe,
indeed, the lines are inserted in the volume called <i>The Poetry of the
Author of the Waverley Novels</i> (which I saw some years ago, but cannot
refer to at this moment), but that is not decisive.</p>

<p>There is a case in point, which is worth quoting on its own account. In
<i>Peveril of the Peak</i>, in the celebrated scene of the interview between
Buckingham and Fenella, where Fenella leaps from the window, and
Buckingham hesitates to follow, there is this passage:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "From a neighbouring thicket of shrubs, amongst which his visitor
   had disappeared, he heard her chant a verse of a comic song, then
   much in fashion, concerning a despairing lover who had recourse
   to a precipice.</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p class="i3">"'But when he came near,</p>
          <p class="i5">Beholding how steep</p>
       <p class="i3"> The sides did appear,</p>
          <p class="i5">And the bottom how deep;</p>
      <p>Though his suit was rejected</p>
       <p>He sadly reflected,</p>
        <p class="i3">That a lover forsaken</p>
        <p class="i5">A new love may get;</p>
       <p class="i3"> But a neck that's once broken</p>
           <p class="i5">Can never be set.'"</p>
</div>

<p>This verse, also, if I mistake not, appears in <i>The Poetry of the Author
of Waverley</i>, and is certainly set down by almost every reader as the
production of Sir Walter. But in the sixth volume of Anderson's <i>Poets
of Great Britain</i>, at page 574. in the works of Walsh, occurs a song
called "The Despairing Lover," in which we are told that&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
      <p>"Distracted with care</p>
     <p> For Phyllis the fair,</p>
      <p>Since nothing could move her,</p>
     <p> Poor Damon, her lover,</p>
     <p> Resolves in despair</p>
      <p>No longer to languish,</p>
     <p> Nor bear so much anguish;</p>
      <p>But, mad with his love,</p>
      <p>To a precipice goes,</p>
      <p>Where a leap from above</p>
      <p>Would soon finish his woes.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
      <p>"When in rage he came there,</p>
       <p class="i3"> Beholding how steep</p>
      <p>The sides did appear,</p>
        <p class="i3">And the bottom how deep,</p>
      <p>His torments projecting,</p>
      <p>And sadly reflecting</p>
      <p>That a lover forsaken,"</p>
      <p>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this instance it is shown that Sir Walter was not indebted for the
comic song to his wonderful genius, but to his stupendous memory; and it
is just possible that it may be so in the other, in which case one would
be very glad to see the remainder of the "old ditty."</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span></h3>

<h4><span>56. <i>Was Milton an Anglo-Saxon Scholar?</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have long been very curious
to know whether Milton was an Anglo-Saxon scholar. He compiled
<a id="compiled101"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[101]</span>
a history of the Saxon period: had he the power of access to the
original sources? Is there any ground for supposing that he had read our
Saxon <i>Paradise Lost</i>; I mean the immortal poetry of Cædmon? If he
really knew nothing of this ancient relic, then it may well be said,
that the poems of Cædmon and of Milton afford the most striking known
example of coincident poetic imagination.</p>

<p>I should be extremely obliged to any of your learned correspondents who
would bring the faintest ray of evidence to bear upon this obscure
question.</p>

<p>The similarity of the two poems has been noticed long ago, <i>e.g.</i> by Sir
F. Palgrave in <i>The Archæologia</i>, xxiv. I know not whether he was the
first; I think Conybeare was beforehand with him.</p>

<h4><span>57. <i>Tale of a Tub.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;What is the origin of this popular phrase? It
dates anterior to the time of Sir Thomas More, an anecdote in whose
chancellorship thus illustrates it. An attorney in his court, named
Tubb, gave an account in court of a cause in which he was concerned,
which the Chancellor (who, with all his gentleness, loved a joke)
thought so rambling and incoherent, that he said at the end of Tubb's
speech, "This is <i>a tale of a Tubb</i>;" plainly showing that the phrase
was then familiarly known.</p>

after saying "His memory deserves high respect," &amp;c., adds, "And though
it seems that a by-word was current of 'Cowper law, to hang a man first
and then judge him,' I believe that it proceeded from party resentment,
rather than from any real fault;" and in a note refers to the evidence
at Lord Wintoun's trial. Is not Lord Mahon mistaken in supposing that
this saying refers to Lord Cowper? Should it not be "Cupar Law," meaning
the town of that name? I see in Lord Wintoun's trial, where his lordship
uses the expression, he adds, "as we used to say in our country." If my
supposition is correct, can any of your correspondents say how the
proverb arose?</p>

<h4><span>65. <i>Borrow's Bible in Spain.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Athenæum</i> for Aug. 17, 1850, in

<p class="blockquot">   "Mr. Wallis imputes a want of judgment and of 'earnest desire'
   for the objects of his mission to Mr. Borrow <i>personally</i>, on the
   ground that he&mdash;being, as all know, sent out by the Bible Society

Protestant and Roman Catholic versions of French, Italian, Portuguese,

attempting to circulate the Roman Catholic versions, on the ground that
it is impossible to circulate the more correct Protestant ones. My

<h4><span>67. <i>A Saxon Bell-house.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A reader of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," who
subscribes himself A L<span class="smcap lowercase">OVER OF</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">ELLS</span>, has kindly referred me to a passage
in Hume's <i>History of England</i>, in which it is said that, according to a
statute of Athelstan, "a ceorle or husbandman who had been able to
purchase five hides of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall, and a
<i>bell</i>," was raised to the rank of a Thane. The marginal reference in
Hume is to Selden's <i>Titles of Honor</i>; and in that work the statue is
then given:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "If a churle or a countryman so thrived that hee had fully five
   hides of his owne land, a church, and a kitchen, a bel-house, a
   borough-gate with a seate, and any distinct office in the king's
   court, then was he henceforth of equall honour or dignitie with a
   Thane."</p>

<p>Selden considers that the <i>bel-house</i> was the dining-hall to which the
guests and family were summoned by the ringing of a bell. He thinks the
word corresponds with <i>tinello</i>, <i>tinelo</i>, and <i>tinel</i>, the Italian,
Spanish, and French words for a "public hall" or "dining-room,"&mdash;"so
named, because the <i>tin</i> or tingling of a bell at the times of dinner or
supper in it were signified by it."</p>

<p>I beg to ask whether the existing knowledge of the details of Saxon
architecture substantiates Selden's view; and whether this bell was also
the alarum-bell of the castle, hanging in an outside turret?</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries Answered.</span></h3>


<h4><span><i>Cycle of the Moon.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform me in what
year the new moon last fell on the <i>1st of January</i>? I am no astronomer,
but I believe the moon's cycles is a period of <i>nineteen years</i>, and
that whenever the new moon falls on the 1st January, the cycle begins.</p>

<p class="right">     B<span class="smcap lowercase">ENBOW</span>.</p>

<p class="left"> Birmingham.</p>


<p class="blockquot"> [The above matter is made the more puzzling to all who are not
   astronomers, by the pertinacity with which popular writers
   persist in speaking of the moon's motions as if they were
   regular.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> There is no particular beginning to the cycle of nineteen years:
   anybody may make it begin when he pleases. What it means is this:
   that in any set of nineteen years, the new and full moons
   generally (not always) fall on the same days as in the preceding
   nineteen years. For instance, in 1831, the 14th of March was a
   day of new moon: go on nineteen years, that is, to the 14th of
   March, 1850; most probably, not certainly, this must be a day of
   new moon. It happens, however, otherwise; for in 1850 the new
   moon is on the 13th. But in the Aprils of both years, the new
   moons are on the 12th; in the Junes, on the 10th. All that can be
   said is, that where any day of any year is new moon, most
   probably <i>that day nineteen years</i> is new moon also, and
   certainly either the day before or the day after. In that cycle
   of nineteen years, which is called the cycle of the <i>golden
   number</i>, there is an arbitrary beginning, which has something to
   do with the new moon falling <i>near</i> the 1st of January. The cycle
   in which we now are, began (that is, had the year marked 1) in
   1843.</p>

<p class="blockquot">To find the last time when the new moon fell on the 1st of
   January with certainty, would be no easy problem for any but an
   astronomer. The nearest which our correspondent can do is this.
   Take Mr. De Morgan's recently published <i>Book of Almanacs</i>, and
   turn to almanac 37. Take the day in question (Jan. 1), and from
   the first of the Roman numbers written opposite (xxx.) subtract
   one (xxix.). Look back into the new style index (p. 7.), then any
   one year which has the epact 29 is very likely to have the new
   moon on the 1st of January; epact 30 may also have it. Now, on
   looking, we find that we are not in that period of the world's
   existence at which epact 29 makes its appearance; no such thing
   has occurred since 1699, nor will occur until 1900. We are then
   in a period in which new moons on the 1st of January are
   comparatively infrequent. Our best chance is when the epact is
   30, as in 1843: here there is a narrow miss of what we want, for
   it was new moon on the day previous, as late as seven in the
   evening.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Our correspondent's notion that the moon's cycle begins with a
   new moon on the 1st of January, is probably derived from this,
   that the calendar is so contrived that for a very long period the
   years which have 1 for their golden number, have a new moon
   <i>near</i> the 1st of January, either on it, or within a day of it.]</p>

<h3><span>BELLARMIN'S MONSTROUS PARADOX.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 45.)</span></h3>

<p>The defence of Cardinal Bellarmin set up by your correspondent J. W. C<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>.
is not new, and is exceedingly plausible at first sight. Allow me,
however, to direct the attention of your readers to the following reply
to a similar defence, which I take from the <i>Sequel to Letters to M.
Gondon</i>, by Dr. Wordsworth, Canon of Westminster, pp. 10. 11.:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "I would first beg leave to observe that my three reviewers, in
   their zeal to speak for Cardinal Bellarmine, have not allowed him
   to speak for himself. They seem not to have remembered that this
   very passage was severely censured in his life-time, and that in
   the <i>Review</i> which <i>he</i> wrote <i>of his own works</i>, by way of
   explanation, he endeavoured to set up a defence for it, which is
   <i>wholly at variance with their apologies</i> for him. He says, 'When
   I affirmed that, if the Pope commanded a vice or forbad a virtue,
   the church would be bound to believe virtue to be evil and vice
   good, I was speaking concerning <i>doubtful</i> acts of virtue or
   vice; for if he ordered a <i>manifest</i> vice, or forbad a <i>manifest</i>
   virtue, it would be necessary to say with St. Peter, We must obey
   God rather than man.' Recognitio Librorum omnium Roberti
   Bellarmini ab ipso edita, Ingolstad, 1608, p. 19. 'Ubi diximus
   quod si Papa præciperet vitium aut prohiberet virtutem, Ecclesia
   teneretur credere virtutem esse malam et vitium esse bonum,
   locuti sumus de actibus <i>dubiis</i> virtutum aut vitiorum; nam si
   præciperet <i>manifestum</i> vitium aut prohiberet <i>manifestam</i>
   virtutem, dicendum esset cum Petro <i>obedire oportet magis Deo
   quam hominibus</i>.'</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"This is his own defence; let it be received for what it is worth;
   it differs entirely from that which the reviewers make for him."</p>

<p>It would occupy too much of your valuable space to insert the whole of
Dr. Wordsworth's observations, which, however, every one who is desirous
of thoroughly investigating the subject, <i>ought</i> to read and consider.</p>

<h3><span>THE GOOKINS OF KENT.<br />
(Vol. i., pp. 385. 492.)</span></h3>

<p>In the 1st volume of the <i>New England Historical and Genealogical
Register</i>, pp. 345., &amp;c., and in subsequent volumes, an interesting
account, by J. W. Thornton, Esq., of Boston, may be found of the
"Gookins of America," who are descendants
<a id="descendants104"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[104]</span> of Sir Vincent
Gookin, Knt., to whom your correspondents refer.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton explains the omission of the descendants of Vincent and
Daniel in the pedigree found in Berry's <i>Kent</i>, p. 113., and which is
from the original visitation in Heralds' College, by the fact, that they
probably went to the co. Cork, and Daniel from thence to Virginia. He
cites undoubted proof that Daniel arrived in Virginia in November, 1621,
and was one of twenty-six patentees to whom, in 1620, King James granted
a patent of land in that colony, they having "undertaken to transport
great multitudes of persons and cattle to Virginia." In 1626 this Daniel
is described in a deed as of "Carygoline, in the county of Cork, within
the kingdom of Ireland, Esquire." In February 1630 a deed is recorded,
made by "Daniel Gookin, of Newport Newes, Virginia, the younger,
Gentleman." Upon the records of the Court of James City, held Nov. 22,
1642, Captain John Gookin is mentioned. Mr. Thornton infers that the
elder Daniel returned to Ireland, and that Daniel the younger, and
Captain John Gookin, were his sons. During the religious troubles which
arose in Virginia, Daniel, junior, and Mary his wife, left for New
England, where they arrived on May 10, 1644, and where he became, as he
had been, a person of considerable influence. He was promoted to the
rank of Major-General in the colony, and died March 19, 1686-7, æt. 75.
For further mention of him, see Carlyle's <i>Letters and Speeches of
Oliver Cromwell</i>, Let. 143. and Note; Thurloe's <i>State Papers</i>, vol. iv.
pp. 6. 440. 449.; vol. v. p. 509.; vol. vi. p. 362. He is spoken of,
says Mr. Thornton, by an authority of the time, as a "Kentish soldier."
Colonel Charles Gookin, whom Penn sent as a governor to his colony, is
described by the latter in a letter, dated London, Sept. 28, 1708, as
"of years and experience," "and of what they call a good family, his
grandfather Sir Vincent Gookin having been an early great planter in
Ireland, in King James First's and the first Charles's days." Governor
Gookin assumed his duties in Pennsylvania in 1708, and was recalled in
1717. He was never married.</p>

<p>In a letter dated Philadelphia, Nov. 28, 1709, Governor Gookin writes to
a grandson of Major-General Daniel Gookin, of New England: "I assure you
that the account you gave me of that part of our family settled in
America was extremely satisfactory;" and again, Nov. 22, 1710, to the
same he says: "By a letter from Ireland I am informed two of our
relatives are lately dead, viz. Robert Gookin, son of my uncle Robert,
and Augustine Gookin, eldest son of my uncle Charles." He subscribes
himself "cousin," &amp;c.</p>

<p>From Mr. Thornton's account, and the remarks of your correspondent, I
think I may venture to deduce the following table:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span>CURIOUS MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTION.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 20.)</span></h3>

<p>The inscription on the tombstone of Christ. Burraway, in Martham Church,
copied by your correspondent E. S. T., singular as it is, and startling
as the story attached to it seems, is not without a parallel, for we
have a similar inscription on another <i>mysterious mother</i> of the name of
Marulla in ancient times, which is given by Boxhornius in his <i>Monumenta
Illustrium Virorum et Elogia</i>, Amst. 1638, fol. 112. He appears to have
found it on a ruined sarcophagus at Rome, of which he has given
representation, and in his Index thus refers to it:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Hersilus cum Marulla, quæ ei mater, soror, et sponsa fuit."</p>

<p>Your correspondent has not mentioned the source of his explanation of
the enigma: I presume it is traditional. The ancient inscription, it
will be seen, solves it in the last two lines. The coincidence of these
two inscriptions is not a little remarkable.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">    "SENICAPRI QVICVMQVE SVBIS SACRARIA FAVNI

<p>In that entertaining volume <i>La Sylva Curiosa de Julian de Medrano,

<p class="blockquot">   "Passing through the Bourbonnese country I was told, that many
   years since a young gentleman there had, by some fortuitous
   accident, lain with his own mother, who became pregnant by him.
   That some time after, a favourable opportunity offering, he went
   to the wars, and was absent from his home some fourteen or
   fifteen years. At the expiration of that time returning home, he
   found his mother well stricken in years, who had a few days
   previous taken into her service a handsome lass, who had been
   brought up from infancy in the mountains of Auvergne. This young
   woman being of a naturally affectionate disposition, seemed much
   attached to her mistress, and relieved her of all her household
   cares, without knowing how nearly they were related; for she was
   her daughter, the fruit of the intercourse with her son, now
   master of the house; notwithstanding there was no one in those
   parts that knew it. The young man seeing her virtuous, graceful,
   and handsome, became enamored of her, in so much that, although
   his relations wished him to marry a rich wife, and all that his
   friends endeavoured to divert his passion, and counselled him to
   bestow his love elsewhere, it was all to no purpose, but,
   preferring her to all others he had seen, he married her. They
   lived together many years, had several children, and were buried
   in the same tomb, without either of them having ever known that
   they were father and daughter, brother and sister! until after a
   lapse of time, a shepherd from Auvergne coming into the
   Bourbonnese country, told the history to the inhabitants of the
   place where this doubly incestuous couple lived. When I passed
   through the country I was shown the spot where they dwelt, and
   the church where they were interred; and a copy of the epitaph
   which was placed upon their tomb was given me, which was as
   follows:</p>

<h3><span>THE LATE MR. WILLIAM HONE.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 477. 508.; Vol. iv., p. 25.)</span></h3>

<p>Having been acquainted with Mr. Hone, when a bookseller in the Strand
(the firm, I think, was Hone and Bone), who published several catalogues
of scarce works in poetry and the drama, I feel some interest in the
question raised upon his religious principles. It was no doubt this
avocation which gave to Mr. Hone that extensive circle of information,
which enabled him to conduct those amusing publications, <i>The Every-day
Book</i>, <i>The Year Book</i>, and <i>The Table Book</i>. In what way my
schoolfellow Charles Lamb became acquainted with Mr. Hone I know not;
but I frequently heard him speak of his misfortunes, and I was witness
to his endeavours to relieve his difficulties, by requesting his
acquaintance to visit the coffee-house which Mrs. Hone opened in
Gracechurch Street. I may communicate hereafter some information upon
the intimacy which existed between Charles Lamb and Mr. Hone; my present
note being confined to some more extensive and interesting pieces of
information relative to Mr. Hone's conversion from infidelity to the
pure principles of Christianity, than are furnished by
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILLIAM</span>
B<span class="smcap lowercase">ARTON</span>. For this purpose I transcribe a letter of Mr. Hone's,
descriptive of his conversion, the cause which led to it, and his
earnest desire to impress upon the public mind his sincerity in the
change which had taken place. A more touching picture of real
conviction, and of a
<a id="of106"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[106]</span> renewed state of mind, is not perhaps upon
record, and cannot too extensively be made known. The letter appeared a
few years ago in the <i>Churchman's Penny Magazine</i>, vol. ii. p. 154.,
with the initials "T. H."</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Your kindness towards me, and the desire you express of becoming
   serviceable to me, require that I should be explicit as regards
   the circumstances under which we met, a little time ago, and have
   since conversed on. I think my statement should be in writing,
   and hence this letter.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"It has pleased the Almighty, to have dealings with me for
   several years, until, by His Holy Spirit, I have been brought
   from darkness to light; to know H<span class="smcap lowercase">IM</span>, through faith in Christ; to
   rest in His love, as in the cleft of a rock, safe from the storms
   and afflictions of the world. To acquaint all who ever heard of
   my name, with this mighty change of heart, has long been my
   desire; and it seems to me, that I ought not to exercise my
   restored faculties without tendering their first fruits as an
   humble offering to the promotion of His cause, by testifying of
   His great mercy. It has been my frequent and earnest prayer to
   God to enable me to do this, as His doing; to seek nothing but
   honour to His holy name, and in the fear of Him, and Him only,
   without regard to the praise or dispraise of man&mdash;come from what
   quarter it may&mdash;to have my soul possessed in patience; to wait
   and be still, as a mere instrument in His hands, made willing in
   the day of His power, to do His work. If it be His work, He will
   bless it: I pray that it may be. Now, in this matter, and in this
   view of it, self-seeking and personal gratification are out of
   the question. The desire to engage in it is the most earnest wish
   of my heart; but my heart was submitted to God, and in submission
   to Him, it seeks to do His will, to do the will of my Saviour, as
   my Lord and my God, who has done all things for me, and will do
   all things well. I believe He has put the desire into my heart to
   do this homage to His sovereignty, as a subject of His kingdom.
   To do it has been the ruling purpose of my mind: as an instance
   of it, let me mention, that I have been frequently asked by
   autograph collectors to write something in their albums. For the
   last two years I have done nothing in this way, till the 3rd of
   last month, a lady having brought in her album the night before,
   I remembered it was my birth-day, and wrote the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>"'The proudest heart that ever beat</p>
       <p class="i3"> Hath been subdued in me;</p>
     <p> The wildest will that ever rose</p>
      <p>To scorn Thy cause, and aid Thy foes,</p>
      <p class="i3">Is quell'd, my God, by Thee.</p>
</div>
    <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Thy will, and not my will, be done;</p>
        <p class="i3">My heart be ever Thine:</p>
      <p>Confessing Thee, the mighty Word,</p>
      <p>My Saviour Christ, my God, my Lord,</p>
      <p class="i3">Thy Cross shall be my sign.'</p>
</div>
</div>

  <p class="blockquot">"These lines, I thought, would be ill placed among contributions
   of different import: I therefore wrote them at the end of my
   Bible, and put some others, of a religious and kindly admonitory
   tendency, in the lady's album. Not even in the albums can I write
   without manifesting, that to please is less my object than to
   acknowledge the goodness of God. Well, then, my dear Sir, in this
   respect you may gather, in some degree, how it is with me, and
   how God has wrought upon my mind, and operates upon it to the end
   I speak of. When His hand struck me as for death, it was in a
   house of prayer, and whilst being carried from the place in men's
   arms as for dead, He lifted my heart to His throne of grace.
   During the loneliness of what seemed to be my dying bed, and the
   discomfort of my awful infirmity, and the ruin of my house, and
   family, and property, He was with me, and comforted me; and
   hitherto He has helped me, and I bless His holy name; my faith in
   Him is unshaken, and He keeps me constantly to himself; and
   despite of worldly affections, and nature's fear, I depend on Him
   and the workings of His providence, that He will never leave me
   nor forsake me. It has never entered my mind, even as a shadow,
   that I can do anything for Him; but what He enables me to do, I
   will do to His glory. In the dark seasons of the hidings of His
   face, I would wait on Him who waited for me while I resisted the
   drawings of His love; and when I sit in the light of His
   countenance, I would stand up and magnify His name before the
   people. And now, that He has wonderfully raised me up, after a
   long season of calamity, to the power of using my pen, I pray
   that He may direct it to tell of His mercy to me, and by what way
   He has brought me to acknowledge Him, 'the Lord our
   righteousness,' 'God blessed for ever,' at all times, and in all
   places, where there may be need of it. I trust I may never be
   ashamed to declare His Name; but readily exemplify, by His help,
   the courage and obedience of a Christian man, and, as a good
   soldier of Christ, fight the good fight with the sword of the
   Spirit.</p>

<p>The foregoing letter may perhaps be considered too pharasaical; but when
is added to it the following note by Mr. Hone, relating the afflictions
which had overtaken him, and well nigh overwhelmed him, it cannot appear
surprising that when he sought comfort and relief from where alone they
are to be found, his heart overflowed with thankfulness and praise.</p>

<p>Mr. Hone, whose friendship I enjoyed for some years, became toward the
latter part of his life a devout and humble Christian, and member of the
dissenting church under the pastorate of the Rev. Thomas Binney, to
which also several members of his family<a id="family3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> belonged. Meeting him
accidentally, about ten years since, in Great Bell Alley, London Wall,
he led me to a small bookshop, kept I think by one of his daughters, and
showed me part of a pamphlet he was then engaged upon, relative to <i>his
own</i> religious life and experience, as I understood him. This, I
believe, has never appeared, though he published in 1841 <i>The early Life
and Conversion of William Hone</i>, of Ripley,<a id="Ripley4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his father.</p>

<p>At p. 46. of this interesting narrative, he subjoins an extract from a
new edition of Simpson's <i>Plea for Religion</i>, printed for Jackson and
Walford, describing the happy change which had taken place in his own
mind. To this account, written, as Mr. Hone says, "by a very dear friend
who knows me intimately," he sets his affirmation; so that there can be
no doubt of its accuracy.</p>

<p>A Life of William Hone, by one who could treat it philosophically, would
be so deeply interesting, that I am surprised it has never been
undertaken. "The history of my three days' trials in Guildhall," says
he, "may be dug out from the journals of the period: the history of my
mind and heart, my scepticism, my atheism, and God's final dealings with
me, remains to be written. If my life be prolonged a few months, the
work may appear in my lifetime." This was written June 3, 1841. Was any
progress, and what, made in it?</p>

<p>Who so fit to "gather up the fragments," as his late pastor, Mr. Binney,
the deeply thoughtful author of one of our best biographies extant, the

<h3><span>PLAIDS AND TARTANS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 7. 77.)</span></h3>

<p>I can assure A L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWLANDER</span> that the reviewer's story is quite true, it
being gathered from Sir John Sinclair, who, in a letter to Mr.
Pinkerton, dated in May, 1796, says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "It is well known that the philibeg was invented by an Englishman
   in Lochabar, about sixty years ago, who naturally thought his
   workmen would be more active in that light petticoat than in the
   belted plaid; and that it was more decent to wear it than to have
   no clothing at all, which was the case with some of those
   employed by him in cutting down the woods in Lochabar."&mdash;See
   Pinkerton's <i>Correspondence</i>, vol. i. p. 404.</p>

<p>I never understood that there was any presumed antiquity about the
philibeg or kilt. In the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> it is described as a
"modern substitute" for the lower part of the plaid.</p>

<p>Presuming, that I have settled this point, I will pass to the original
Query of a J<span class="smcap lowercase">UROR</span>, p. 7., still quoting Pinkerton:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "There is very little doubt but that the 'Tartan' passed from
   Flanders (whence all our articles came) to the Lowlands in the
   fifteenth century, and thence to the Highlands. It is never
   mentioned before the latter part of that century. It first occurs
   in the accompts of James III., 1474, and seems to have passed
   from England; for the 'rouge tartarin' in the statutes of the
   Order of the Bath in the time of Edward IV. (apud Upton de Re
   Milit.) is surely red tartan, or cloth with red stripes of
   various shades."</p>

<p class="noindent">Again&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"As to the plaid, there is no reason to believe it more ancient
   than the philibeg. In the sixteenth century Fordun (lib. ii. cap.
   9.) only mentions the Highland people as 'amictu deformis,' a
   term conveying the idea of a vague savage dress of skins.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"In the book of dress printed at Paris in 1562, the Highland
   chief is in the Irish dress wearing a mantle. The woman is
   dressed in sheep and deer skins. Lesley, in 1570, is the first
   who mentions the modern Highland dress, but represents the tartan
   as even then being exclusively confined to the use of people of
   rank.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Buchanan, 1580, mentions the plaids, but says they are <i>brown</i>;
   even as late as 1715 the remote Highlanders were only clothed in
   a long coat buttoned down to the mid-leg; this information was
   derived from the minister of Mulmearn (father of the Professor
   Ferguson), who said 'that those Highlanders who joined the
   Pretender from the most remote parts, were not dressed in
   party-coloured tartans, and had neither plaid nor philibeg.'"</p>

<p>So much for the assumed antiquity of the Scottish national costume. More
interesting matter on this subject will be found in Pinkerton's
<i>Correspondence</i>, vol. i. pp. 404-410.</p>

<h3><span>THE CAXTON MEMORIAL.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 33. 69.)</span></h3>

<p>Whatever be the fate of <i>The Caxton Memorial</i>, as suggested by myself,
the proposition is clear of interested motives. I neither aspire to the
honours of a patron, nor to the honours of editorship. To
<a id="editorship108"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[108]</span>
revive the memory of the man, and to illustrate the literature of the
period, are my sole objects.</p>

<p>I have to thank M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span> for his polite information. I was aware of
the meeting of the 9th of July 1849, but not aware that the proposal of
a <i>statue of Caxton</i> had been entertained at so early a date. The
proceedings of the meeting, as reported in <i>The Times</i>, were confined to
the question of subscriptions: on the statue question there is not the
slightest hint.</p>

<p>The advocacy of a <i>fictitious statue</i> by so eminent an antiquary as
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span>, and the assurance which he gives that this object has been
under consideration for at least two years, make it the more imperative
on me to state my objections to it; and this I shall do with reference
to his own arguments.</p>

<p>A maxim of the illustrious sir William Jones very apposite to the point
in dispute, has floated in my memory from early life. It is this: "The
best monument that can be erected to a man of literary talents is a good
edition of his works." Such a man was William Caxton; and on this
principle I would proceed. He would then owe the extension of his fame
to the admirable art which he so successfully practised.</p>

<p>In the opinion of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span>, the expense attendant on my project
would be "fatal to its success." Now, as the Shakespeare Society prints
at the rate of four volumes for a subscription of 1<i>l.</i>, the committee
of the <i>Caxton Memorial</i> could surely produce one volume for 10<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> I should not advise any attempt at splendour. Paper such as Caxton
would have chosen, a clear type, and extreme accuracy of text, are more
important objects. Competent editors would soon offer their services;
and, proud to have their names associated with so desirable an
enterprise, would perform their parts with correspondent care and
ability. Besides, it is easier to collect subscriptions, when you can
promise a substantial return.</p>

<p>To the other objections of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span>, I shall reply more briefly. The
biography of Caxton by Lewis is a very <i>scarce</i> book; and, in the
opinion of Dibdin, "among the dullest of all biographical memoirs." As
to that by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. K<span class="smcap lowercase">NIGHT</span>, only one fourth part of it relates to Caxton. In
the <i>Typographical antiquities</i> we certainly have "copious extracts from
his works;" but they are mixed up with much superfluity of disquisition.
Whether such a memorial would be "hidden in a bookcase," must depend on
the taste of the possessor. It would be <i>accessible</i> in the four
quarters of the globe&mdash;which is as much as can be said of other books,
and more than can be said of a statue.</p>

<p>I cannot admit the propriety of viewing Caxton as a mere printer. By
continental writers he is more correctly appreciated. M. de la Serna
calls him "homme de lettres, artiste renommé," etc.; and M. Suard
observes, "dans presque tous les ouvrages imprimés par lui, il a inséré
quelques lignes qui toujours attestent la pureté des intentions dont il
était animé."</p>

<p>The advocates of a <i>fictitious statue</i> of Caxton have been apprized of
my intention, and if certain estimable antiquaries should prove to be of
the number, they must consider my opposition as the consequence of
general principles.</p>

<p>It should be the object of antiquaries to illustrate "the <i>history</i> of
former times"&mdash;as we read in a royal charter&mdash;not to substitute fiction
for history. Now, it is admitted by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span> that there is "no
authentic portrait of Caxton." How then, he must allow me to ask, can it
be assumed that the <i>picture by Maclise is truthful</i>? It may be much
otherwise. Modern artists are no guides for antiquaries.</p>

<p>It is with statues as it is with medals. The first and most obvious use
of them, as Addison remarks of the latter objects, is "the showing us
the <i>faces</i>" of eminent persons. Even Horace Walpole, who has misled so
many with regard to Caxton, has expressed himself very forcibly on the
value of <i>real</i> portraits. If a statue fail in that particular, it is
worthless; and should my own project find no favour with the public&mdash;a
fountain by day&mdash;or, a light by night&mdash;or, an inscribed obelisk&mdash;or,
even an inscribed tablet&mdash;would be far preferable as a monument.</p>

<p>If the dean of St. Paul's should resolve to place in other hands the sum
which has been collected for this purpose, he may justly insist on the
proper application of it; and as the Society of Arts may be induced to
take charge of it, I must remind them of the circumstance under which
the subscriptions were formerly obtained. It was assumed that a likeness
of Caxton had been preserved. I transcribe from <i>The Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">The meeting, [12 June, 1847] appeared to have been gratified with
   what they had seen and heard, and he [lord Morpeth] had only now
   to say to them, and to their fellow-countrymen in every part of
   the world, 'Subscribe.' (Applause.)</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "A miniature portrait of Caxton, painted upon enamel by Mr. Bone,
   was handed to lord Morpeth, who stated that it had been copied
   from a likeness of Caxton, in an old illuminated MS."</p>

<p>His lordship was misinformed as to the authenticity of the portrait, it
being copied from the Lambeth Ms.&mdash;but that circumstance does not affect
the argument.</p>

<p>It is manifest, therefore, that a <i>fictitious statue</i> of Caxton,
objectionable as it would be on other accounts, would also be very like
a breach of faith with the original subscribers.</p>

<h3><span>LADY FLORA HASTINGS' BEQUEST.<br />

 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>,"

<p class="blockquot">Cardiff, Aug. 5. 1851.]</p>

<p>A friend has copied and sent to me a passage in the paper named
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," of Saturday, July 19. 1851, No. 90. page 44.</p>

<p>The passage refers to my sister, Lady Flora Hastings, and a poem
ascribed to her. If it were a matter solely of literary nature, I should
not have interfered; considering the point in debate may not be
interesting to a very extended circle of persons. But I feel it is a
duty not to allow an undeserved imputation to rest on any one,
especially on one styled a "Christian lady." Probably no person but
myself can place the debated question beyond doubt. I do not know who
the "Christian lady" or who E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> may be; but the lines entitled "Lady
Flora Hastings' Bequest" are not by Lady Flora Hastings. She solemnly
bequeathed <i>all</i> her papers and manuscripts to me, and those verses are
not amongst them; else they should have been included in the volume of
her poems which I published. Moreover, Lady Flora Hastings never parted
with her Bible till, by my brother's desire, I had warned her on the
authority of the physicians that <i>any</i> hour might close her existence on
earth. She was then unable to read it to herself. It was to <i>me</i> (not to
my brother, as stated by C<span class="smcap lowercase">HARLOTTE</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">LIZABETH</span>) that she confided the book
and the message for our mother; and when she did so, she was too weak in
body to have committed the simple words of the message to paper. I was
with her night and day for many days before she gave the gift and
message to my care, and she died in my arms. She could not have composed
any verses, or written a word, or dictated a sentence, without my
knowledge, for more than a week before she died.</p>

<h4><span><i>Inscription on an old Board</i></span> <span> (Vol. iii., p. 240.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I would suggest
that the 31st chapter of Genesis may solve this riddle. We have in the
latter part of that chapter the account of a covenant entered into
between Jacob and Laban, and we are there told that a pillar was erected
as a witness between them of this covenant; Jacob calling it Galeed,
also Mizpah. May not the inscription on the board be a token of some
covenant of the same kind; and may it not have been placed on a pillar,
or on some conspicuous place on the exterior of the house, or over the
mantel in some room of the house (this latter being suggested in the
article describing the board)? If I am correct, the name of the person
who did "indite" the inscription should be one which, if not spelt
exactly like Galeed or Mizpah, would in sound resemble the one or the
other.</p>

<p>&mdash;In the
Episcopal churches of our country this custom is religiously observed;
the foliage of the holly, cedar, and pine being chiefly used for this
purpose at the south, together with artificial flowers. At Easter also

that season natural flowers are also used for the purpose, mingled with
the evergreen foliage of the trees mentioned above.</p>

<h4><span><i>Royal Library</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 69.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The letter addressed by King George
IV. to the Earl of Liverpool, referred to in the above page, will be
found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for February, 1823, page 161. It is
dated from the Pavilion, Brighton, on the 15th of the preceding month.</p>

<p>The Committee, in their Parliamentary Report, state that the king had
accompanied his munificent <i>donation</i> of this library to the public,
"with the <i>gift</i> of a valuable selection of coins and medals;" and they
close their Report in the following words:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The Committee would not do justice to the sentiments with which
   they are affected, if they failed to express in the strongest
   terms the gratitude they feel, in common with the nation, <i>for
   the act of munificent liberality</i> which has brought this subject
   under their consideration, and for the disposition which is so
   strongly evinced by that act, on the part of his Majesty, of
   promoting, by the best means, the science and literature of the
   country."</p>

<p>Would all this have been said, if the value of the library, in "pounds
sterling" was, as has been alleged, to be made good by the country to
its late owner?</p>

<p>When urging that this library, containing about 65,000 volumes, might
have been preserved at Whitehall, or in some other part of Westminster,
as a <i>distinct</i> collection, it may be stated, that on its removal to the
Museum, 21,000 duplicates were found in the united libraries, but that
"it was not considered advisable <i>to part with more</i> than 12,000; which
should be taken from books in the Museum." Why should not the Museum
have <i>retained</i> its duplicates, leaving those in the royal library for
the benefit of readers in another part of the metropolis? Was the
expense of a separate establishment the great obstacle?</p>

<h4><span><i>Proof of a Sword</i></span> <span>(vol. iv., p. 39.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">NSIS</span> asks, "What is the usual
test of a good blade?" The proof by striking on the surface of smooth
water, is not uncommon in India; though, in my
<a id="my110"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[110]</span> opinion, it is a
very inefficient one, and there is no doubt that "the Toledo blades in
the Crystal Palace" would stand it as well as any others of moderate
goodness. "The Toledo blades that <i>roll</i> up in a circle" can be as
easily made in England as in Spain, but they are useless toys: there is
an English one in the Exhibition, Class viii., Case 200., which fits
into the circular Toledo scabbard placed above it; but they are only
curious to the uninitiated. What, then, is an efficient proof? I reply,
first strike the flat side of the blade on an iron table (by means of a
machine) with a force of 300 to 400 lbs., and then on the edge and back
over a round piece of hard wood with a force of 400 to 500 lbs.: after
which thrust the point as hard as possible against a thick iron plate
and through a cuirass, without turning or breaking it, and bend so as to
reduce the length in the proportion of about one inch and a half to a
foot. When thus proved, a sword may be relied on, and the operation may
be seen every day at 27. Pall Mall.</p>

Narcissa of the <i>Night Thoughts</i> was a daughter of his wife (Lady
Elizabeth Lee), by her former husband, Colonel Lee. The writer in the

remaining volumes of this important work, notwithstanding DR. TODD'S
prompt communication on the subject. He speaks of the 14th volume half
printed off, and asks for information which may assist him in completing
it; and then announces that highly desirable addition, viz. an Index,
which is to form the 17th volume; but of the projected contents of vols.
xv. and xvi., he says nothing.<a id="nothing5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> </p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn5"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#nothing5" class="label">[5]</a> Vols. xv. and xvi., consisting of Letters to and from
Archbishop Ussher, were published early in 1849.</p>

<p>In spite of Dr. Elrington's rejection of the <i>Body of Divinity</i> (which
is doubtless what D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">ODD</span> refers to under the name of the <i>System of
Theology</i>), I would still venture to plead for at least an uniform
edition of it; for there is surely much force in the testimony of Dr. N.
Bernard (as quoted by Mr. Goode), that, whilst the Archbishop was
"indeed displeased at the publishing of it, without his knowledge, but
hearing of some good fruit which hath been reaped by it, he hath
<i>permitted it</i>."</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Several other editions, therefore," (Mr. Goode adds) "were
   published in his lifetime; and being thus published with his
   <i>permission</i>, must of course be considered as in all important
   points of doctrine representing his views."&mdash;<i>Effects of Infant Baptism</i>, pp. 312, 313.</p>

<p>Possibly some of your correspondents might be able to throw light on
this point.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be travelling out of the record to entreat that the
Index may be printed on anything but the dazzling milled paper, which
everybody I should think must detest.</p>

<h4><span><i>Was Stella Swift's Sister?</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 450.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;J. H. S. will find
this question raised in the <i>The closing Years of Dean Swift's Life</i>, by
W. R. Wilde, M.R.I.A.:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"That Stella was the daughter of Sir Wm. Temple appears more than
   probable; but that Swift was his son, and consequently her half
   brother, remains to be proved. It has, it is true, been often
   surmised, from the date of Orrery's book to the present time, but
   we cannot discover in the supposition anything but vague
   conjecture."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilde, however, proceeds to quote in favour of the opinion from an
article in <i>The Gentleman's and London Magazine</i>, pp. 555. to 560.,
Dublin. Printed for John Exshaw, Nov. 1757.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Mistletoe</i></span> <span>(Vol. ii., pp. 163. 214.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The mistletoe is common on
almost every tree of our Southern forests; it is abundant on all the
varieties of the oak, and grows most luxuriously on the trees near our
watercourses. I have seen some of our deciduous trees looking almost as
green in winter as when clothed in their own foliage in summer, in
consequence of the quantity of mistletoe growing upon them.</p>

<h4><span><i>Family of Kyme</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 23.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The match of Kyme with Cicely,
second daughter of Edward the Fourth, and widow of John, Lord Welles,
is
<a id="is111"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[111]</span> mentioned by Anderson, Yorke, Brooke, and Vincent; but these
writers agree that she had no issue by this marriage.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLD</span> is probably aware that there are a few descents of the family of
Kyme of Stickford, coming down to the latter end of the sixteenth
century, to be found in a "Visitation of Lincolnshire," Harl. MS. No.
1550., fo. 60. b.</p>

<p>The following notice of some supposed descendants of the ancient family
of Kyme, is given in Thompson's <i>History of Boston</i>, 4to. Lond. 1820,
pp. 173. to 176.:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Richmond Rochford, or Kyme Tower.</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "At what time this estate passed from the Kyme family has not
   been ascertained: it fell into the hands of the crown by
   sequestration, in consequence of some political transgression of
   its owner, and is now the property of the Dean and Chapter of
   Westminster. The descendants of the ancient owners, however,
   continued to occupy the estate as tenants, until 1816.<a id="until6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

     <p class="blockquot"> "The tower is situated about two miles east of Boston.... An old
   house adjoining the Tower was taken down a few years since: in
   this house were several old portraits, said to be of the Kyme
   family: there were also three coats of arms, with different
   bearings, but with this same motto: 'In cruce nostra salus.'"</p>

 <p class="footnote"><a id="fn6"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#until6" class="label">[6]</a> Adlard Kyme was tenant 1709.</p>

 the editor of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span>

information respecting the descendants of the Kymes of Kyme Tower.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Leman Baronetcy</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 58.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In answer to your
correspondent H. M., I beg to state that Sir Edward Leman, Baronet,
resides at Nottingham. He tried his right as to the baronetcy at the
Canongate Court in Edinburgh, in the year 1842, and was gazetted as the
legal baronet and rightful descendant of Sir Tanfeild Leman, who
succeeded Sir William Lenten of Northaw. I have the original gazette and
a certified court copy of the proceedings on the occasion, which I shall
be happy to show your correspondent, with all other information and
papers relative to the Leman family, if he will favour me with his
address.</p>

minute quantity of creosote contained in each dose. Dr. Elliotson tried
the same nauseous remedy with partial success at St. Thomas's Hospital,

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
